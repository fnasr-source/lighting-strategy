## Data Quality + Caveats
- This report intentionally scopes to the two specified SimLabs campaigns only.
- Open/click *person-level* insights are constrained when tracking is disabled; aggregate counts may still appear depending on historical settings and provider behavior.
- `who received` is sourced from `to_address_email_list` in Instantly email activity logs.
- `who replied` is inferred from `ue_type` patterns in email activity logs; confirm with mailbox thread-level audit if needed.
