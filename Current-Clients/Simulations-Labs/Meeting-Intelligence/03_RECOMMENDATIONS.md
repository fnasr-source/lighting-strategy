# Simulations Labs — Recommendations (Initial)

1. Keep meeting intelligence ingestion on a batched scheduler (small windows).
2. Normalize all transcript events into one schema before analysis.
3. Enforce owner + due-date extraction from every meeting.
4. Link meeting outcomes directly to current client pipeline tasks.

This file will be updated after full transcript ingestion.
