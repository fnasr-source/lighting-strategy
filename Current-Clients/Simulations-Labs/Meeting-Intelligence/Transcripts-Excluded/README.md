# Transcripts-Excluded

This folder contains transcript files that were previously placed under the Simulations Labs workspace but do not match Simulations Labs/QYD scope.

Purpose:
- preserve history and traceability
- avoid accidental data loss
- keep `Transcripts/` clean for dashboard-ready Simulations Labs intelligence
