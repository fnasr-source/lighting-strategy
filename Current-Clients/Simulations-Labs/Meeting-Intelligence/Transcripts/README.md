# Transcripts

This folder is strictly for **Simulations Labs (QYD alias) meetings only**.

Contents (one markdown per meeting):
- metadata (date, participants, links)
- full transcript body
- extracted action items

## Scope rule
- Allowed here: files clearly tied to Simulations Labs/QYD.
- Non-related meetings (e.g., generic standups, other clients) must go to:
  - `../Transcripts-Excluded/`

Run audit:
- `python3 ../scripts/audit_transcripts.py`
