You are a senior full-stack architect. Build a production-ready Unified Outreach Data Hub on Firebase/GCP.

Context:
- We use Firebase Hosting + Firestore + Cloud Functions/Run.
- We need one internal control plane for leads/campaigns/insights.
- Execution providers: Instantly, Resend, HubSpot (adapter-based).
- Source of truth must stay internal.
- Must support per-contact timeline and unified reporting.

What to produce:
1) Technical architecture (services, queues, schedulers, secrets, monitoring).
2) Firestore schema and indexes.
3) Adapter interface and concrete implementation plan for Instantly first.
4) Webhook ingestion + reconciliation polling design.
5) Idempotency strategy (keys and dedup logic).
6) API endpoints (admin + internal jobs).
7) Security model (RBAC, webhook verification, PII handling).
8) Failure/retry strategy and dead-letter handling.
9) MVP roadmap in phases with effort estimates.
10) Risks and mitigations.

Constraints:
- Keep provider-agnostic core.
- Avoid vendor lock-in in business logic.
- Prefer simple maintainable design over over-engineering.
- Include example payloads and normalized UnifiedEvent format.

Output format:
- Start with an executive summary.
- Then architecture diagram in text.
- Then implementation details with checklists.
- Then phased roadmap and go-live checklist.
