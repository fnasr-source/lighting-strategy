## Email Body
Hi Mahmoud,

Thank you for today’s meeting.

As discussed, we updated the proposal based on your exact direction:
- Two fixed options only (no revenue sharing)
- Strategy is included in both options
- Higher option includes full management and media buying management
- Channel plan aligned to ROI and project-buyer targeting

### Option 1 - Fixed Build + Monthly Support
- **45,000 EGP** setup
- **7,500 EGP/month** support
- Includes strategy, funnel/build setup, and monthly updates

### Option 2 - Managed Growth + Media Buying (Higher Option)
- **35,000 EGP** setup
- **17,500 EGP/month** (minimum 3 months)
- Includes everything in Option 1 plus Google Ads management, Apollo-based lead workflows, follow-up management, and weekly optimization/reporting

### Recommended start
We recommend **Option 2** so we can actively manage acquisition channels and optimize ROI from the start.
