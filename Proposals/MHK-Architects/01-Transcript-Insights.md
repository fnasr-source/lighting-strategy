## 1. Client Needs — What Omar Actually Wants

| Need | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Lead generation campaigns | 🔴 Critical | Core reason for re-engagement |
| Video content strategy | 🔴 Critical | Has videographer ready; needs direction + scripts |
| Landing page with lead magnet video | 🟡 High | Video-gated form flow for qualified leads |
| Small always-on boosting | 🟢 Nice-to-have | Follower growth, portfolio presence |

## 2. What He Does NOT Want
- ❌ Full social media management
- ❌ Organic growth / brand awareness campaigns
- ❌ Daily content posting schedule
- ❌ Expensive website redesign
- ❌ Brand positioning campaigns

## 3. Business Constraints

**Design Bottleneck:** Omar is the sole designer. No quality designers available in Egypt to hire. This limits capacity to **4–5 villas per year**.

**Revenue Model:** Design fee upfront → 50% cashback applied to execution contract. Real margin is in execution/contracting.

**Campaign Cycle:** Run campaign → get leads → close 1–2 → pause → deliver → repeat.

## 4. The Marketing Asset — Current Project

Omar's "Mehnaaz Story" apartment project (~100sqm) is his crown jewel:
- Famous within its compound — residents seek it out
- Has professional videographer creating 7+ Reels + cinematic movie
- 25+ professional photos
- 3D renders match 95% to final reality — powerful before/after comparison
- This is the content that should fuel the next campaign

## 5. Recommended Approach (From Meeting Discussion)

1. **Lead Magnet Video:** Create a 15–30 minute documentary/interview style video showcasing the project journey → use as gated content in the lead funnel
2. **Short-form Content:** Extract 7+ Reels from the project → drip into Instagram
3. **Landing Page:** Simple form with video embed — leads must watch before submitting
4. **Meta Ads Campaign:** Target compound homeowners in New Cairo / New Capital
5. **Follow-up Nurture:** Send differentiation content to lukewarm leads over time

## 6. Action Items

1. Omar sends 3D renders + after photos → Fouad + Esraa
2. Schedule sync with Omar + videographer → plan lead-gen video
3. Admireworks drafts video scripts/scenes
4. Admireworks prepares campaign proposal
