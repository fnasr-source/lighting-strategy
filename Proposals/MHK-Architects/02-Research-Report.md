**Prepared for:** Internal Use — Meeting Preparation
**From:** Admireworks Strategy Team
**Client Contact:** MHK Architects (Returning Client — Previously Performance Marketing)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

MHK Architects is a **luxury interior design, architecture, and contracting firm** based in New Cairo's 5th Settlement, with an expanding regional footprint (Cairo 🇪🇬, Dammam 🇸🇦, Dubai 🇦🇪). They offer a premium **turnkey A-to-Z service** — from concept design through implementation and furnishing — targeting high-end homeowners in Egypt's booming real estate market. Their tagline, **"Simplicity is Luxury"**, positions them firmly in the premium segment.

Despite delivering visually stunning projects (El Patio Casa, Midtown Villa, Stone Residence, Al-Futtaim HQ), their **digital presence severely underdelivers** for a firm of their caliber. Their Instagram has 15K followers but only 10–15 likes per post. Their website is a bare-minimum WordPress page with no portfolio showcase. They have **no content strategy, no SEO, no lead generation system, and no digital sales funnel** — leaving massive revenue on the table in a market growing at **8.9% CAGR**.

This is a **returning client** (previously performance marketing / ads management only). They now want to explore the **full scope of our services** including online marketing, content, and potentially sales support. The opportunity is significant.
