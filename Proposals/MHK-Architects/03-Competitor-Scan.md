**Date:** February 22, 2026
**Prepared for:** Internal Use — Meeting Preparation
**From:** Admireworks Strategy Team

## 1. Competitive Landscape Overview

The Egyptian luxury interior design market features a growing roster of established and emerging firms, particularly clustered around **New Cairo's 5th Settlement and Katameya**. The market is driven by massive compound developments (SODIC, Palm Hills, Mountain View, Ora Developers) and the New Administrative Capital.

Despite the market's growth, **no single firm dominates digitally**. Most rely on word-of-mouth and Instagram portfolios, creating an opportunity for MHK to establish digital-first market leadership.

**MHK's unique position:** They sit at the intersection of **"Turnkey Full Service"** and **"Premium/Ultra-Luxury"** — a position that few competitors occupy. HSI and Flair are premium but may not offer the same complete A-to-Z scope.

## 6. Market Opportunity Assessment

### Where MHK Can Win
1. 🏆 **Full turnkey positioning** — design + build + furnish is rare at the premium level
2. 🌍 **Three-country reach** — no competitor matches CAI + DMM + DXB
3. 📱 **TikTok/YouTube first-mover** — no competitor is doing video content well
4. 📌 **Pinterest domination** — interior design's #1 discovery platform is unclaimed
5. 🏢 **B2B commercial** — Al-Futtaim HQ proves commercial capability

### Where MHK Is Vulnerable
1. 🌐 **Zero web portfolio** — while every competitor has one
2. 📉 **0.1% engagement** — effectively invisible to their own followers
3. 🏆 **No public awards** — competitors use awards for credibility
4. 🔇 **No PR/media presence** — competitors get featured in design publications
5. 📊 **No reviews/testimonials** — only 1 Facebook review from 2 years ago
