# 06-Offer-and-Proposal: MHK Architects — Omar Hassan

**FROM:** Admireworks
**TO:** Omar Hassan — MHK Architects
**DATE:** February 22, 2026
**MEETING REF:** AW - M.H.K - February 22, 2026

---

## Executive Offer

Based on the February 22 meeting, we are building a **video-first lead generation system** for MHK Architects. The approach is designed around Omar's stated priorities: targeted lead generation, low overhead, and campaign-based engagement.

Both options focus on **performance-driven campaigns** with the current project (Mehnaaz Story) as the hero content asset. No brand positioning, no organic social management — pure lead generation.

---

## Scope Foundation (Included in Both Options)

### Phase 1: Video Content Strategy (Week 1–2)
- Creative direction meeting with Omar + videographer
- Script and shot list for lead magnet video (documentary/interview format)
- Scene outline for 15–30 min hero video
- Short-form content plan: 7+ Reels from project

### Phase 2: Funnel Build (Week 2–3)
- Landing page with video embed + lead capture form
- Lead qualification flow (video must be watched before form)
- WhatsApp follow-up integration
- Campaign creative development (ad sets, copy, visuals)

### Phase 3: Campaign Launch & Optimization (Week 3+)
- Meta Ads campaign targeting New Cairo / New Capital compound homeowners
- Campaign monitoring and optimization
- Lead quality reporting
- Performance-based budget recommendations

---

## Option 1: Campaign Sprint — Build + Launch

### Commercial
- **Setup:** 25,000 EGP (one-time)
- **Ad Management:** 5,000 EGP/month (minimum 2 months)

### Includes
- Video creative direction + scripting for videographer
- Landing page build with video-gated lead form
- Campaign setup + launch (Meta Ads)
- Bi-weekly optimization and lead quality reports
- WhatsApp follow-up flow setup

### Best For
- Getting the next 3–4 leads quickly with the current project as hero content
- Campaign-based engagement (run → close → pause → repeat)

### Does Not Include
- Ad spend (billed directly to client accounts)
- Content production / videography (client has own videographer)
- Social media management

---

## Option 2: Managed Growth — Campaigns + Content Direction + Lead Nurture

### Commercial
- **Setup:** 20,000 EGP (one-time — reduced because of existing relationship)
- **Monthly:** 12,500 EGP/month (minimum 3 months)

### Includes
- Everything in Option 1
- Ongoing content direction: monthly shot lists, script ideas, posting sequence
- Lead nurture system: email/WhatsApp drip sequences for lukewarm leads
- Multi-project content planning (sequence new projects as they complete)
- Periodic boosting management for follower growth
- Monthly strategy review call

### Best For
- Year-round presence with always-on low-budget campaigns
- Building a lead pipeline that compounds over time
- Not needing to restart from scratch each campaign cycle

### Notes
- Ad spend billed directly to client accounts
- No revenue sharing
- Content production by client's videographer, directed by Admireworks

---

## Recommendation

**Option 2** aligns best with the meeting discussion. Omar expressed interest in:
- Year-round low-budget presence
- Having Admireworks provide creative direction for his videographer
- Lead nurture for lukewarm leads (addressing the "differentiation gap")
- On-demand campaign scaling when ready for new projects

The reduced setup fee reflects the existing relationship and trust built over 6+ months of previous collaboration.

---

## Next Steps

1. Omar sends current project 3D renders + after photos
2. Schedule sync with Omar + videographer
3. Confirm Option 1 or Option 2
4. Process initial payment and begin video creative direction
