# 06-Offer-and-Proposal: MHK Architects — Omar Hassan

**FROM:** Admireworks
**TO:** Omar Hassan — MHK Architects
**DATE:** February 22, 2026
**MEETING REF:** AW - M.H.K - February 22, 2026

---

## Executive Offer

Based on the February 22 meeting, we are building a **video-first lead generation system** for MHK Architects. The approach is designed around Omar's priorities: targeted lead generation, low overhead, and campaign-based engagement.

The offer is built on our standard managed advertising service, with an additional asset-building component spread across the engagement period. No brand positioning, no organic social management — pure lead generation.

## The Approach — Video-First Lead Generation

1. **Hero Content:** Documentary-style video from current project (Mehnaaz Story) — 3D vs reality comparison, project journey, Omar interview
2. **Lead Magnet:** Prospects watch the video before accessing the form — builds trust and qualifies serious inquiries
3. **Campaign Targeting:** New Cairo and New Capital compound homeowners (El Patio, SODIC, Midtown, Mountain View)
4. **Nurture:** Leads who don't convert immediately receive drip content showing MHK's differentiation over time
5. **Content Pipeline:** 7+ Reels per project, cinematic reveal video, interview clips — all directed by Admireworks, shot by Omar's videographer

---

## Recommendation

Both options include the same scope. The difference is payment structure only.

- **Option 1** suits clients who prefer to settle the asset cost upfront and keep a lower monthly.
- **Option 2** suits clients who prefer to spread costs and commit to a longer engagement period.

---

## Next Steps

1. Omar sends current project 3D renders + after photos
2. Schedule creative sync with Omar + videographer
3. Confirm Option 1 or Option 2
4. Process initial payment and begin video creative direction
