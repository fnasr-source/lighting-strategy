## The Approach — Video-First Lead Generation

1. **Hero Content:** Documentary-style video from current project (Mehnaaz Story) — 3D vs reality comparison, project journey, Omar interview
2. **Lead Magnet:** Prospects watch the video before accessing the form — builds trust and qualifies serious inquiries
3. **Campaign Targeting:** New Cairo and New Capital compound homeowners (El Patio, SODIC, Midtown, Mountain View)
4. **Nurture:** Leads who don't convert immediately receive drip content showing MHK's differentiation over time
5. **Content Pipeline:** 7+ Reels per project, cinematic reveal video, interview clips — all directed by Admireworks, shot by client's videographer

---

## Recommendation

Both options include the same scope and service level. The difference is the payment model.

- **Option 1** suits clients who prefer to own all assets outright from day one. Higher upfront, lower monthly.
- **Option 2** suits clients who prefer a lower entry point with an ongoing subscription. Assets are transferred after 12 months of service.

---

## Next Steps

1. Omar sends current project 3D renders + after photos
2. Schedule creative sync with Omar + videographer
3. Confirm Option 1 or Option 2
4. Process initial payment and begin video creative direction
