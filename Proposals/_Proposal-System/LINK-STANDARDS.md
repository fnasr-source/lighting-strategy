# Link Standards (Client-Facing Emails)

## Rule
Do not include plain raw links in client-facing emails.

Email subject should follow:
- `{Agency Name} x {Project/Business Name}`

Use action text with emoji and hyperlink format:
- `👉 [View Proposal](URL)`
- `👉 [Open Payment Link](URL)`
- `👉 [Pay via Instapay](https://ipn.eg/S/admireworks/instapay/5A1jri)`
- `👉 [View Agreement](URL)`

## Why
- Cleaner email experience
- Clear action intent
- Consistent communication style

## Applies To
- Proposal emails
- Follow-up emails
- Payment emails
