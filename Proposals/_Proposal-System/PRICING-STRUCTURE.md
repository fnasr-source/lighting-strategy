# Admireworks Proposal Pricing Structure

> **Last Updated:** February 22, 2026
> **Source:** Fouad Nasseredin (verbal briefing)
> **Purpose:** Standard pricing reference for all future proposals

---

## Core Service: Ad Campaign Management

This is the main service — managing ad performance on **one ad platform** (typically Meta Ads).

### Egyptian Market Clients (campaigns targeting Egypt)
- **Price:** $260 USD/month equivalent in EGP
- **As of Feb 2026:** ~12,500 EGP/month (at ~47.5 EGP/USD)
- **Always round** to a clean, professional figure in the proposal

### International Market Clients
| Client Location | Monthly Price |
|---|---|
| **UAE** | 1,200 AED/month |
| **Saudi Arabia** | 1,200 SAR/month |
| **All other markets** | $330 USD/month equivalent |
| **Egyptian client targeting outside Egypt** | $330 USD/month equivalent |

> **Key rule:** If the client is Egyptian but their campaigns target a market outside Egypt, they pay the international rate ($330 USD equivalent), not the Egyptian rate.

## Growth System (Add-On)

Covers the creation and maintenance of all marketing infrastructure: landing pages, lead funnels, campaign creative suites, follow-up flows, content direction, etc.

### Payment Options (present as two options in proposals)

**Option A — Bulk Payment ("Own Your Assets"):**
- 45,000 EGP one-time for all growth assets
- Assets are built over the first 3 months
- Client owns all assets from day one
- Lower ongoing monthly (ad management only)

**Option B — Growth System Subscription:**
- 5,500 EGP/month subscription
- Client pays **3 months upfront** at engagement start
- All assets built, maintained, and optimized as part of the subscription
- Total monthly = ad management + subscription (e.g., 12,500 + 5,500 = 18,000 EGP/month for Egyptian market)

### Asset Transfer Rule
- During the subscription, assets belong to Admireworks
- **Upon completing 12 months of continuous subscription, all growth assets are transferred to the client at no additional cost**
- If the client terminates before 12 months, assets are not transferred
- Option A clients own assets from day one (no transfer needed)

---

## Upfront Payment Rules

### Ad Campaign Management
- **First 3 months are always paid upfront** at engagement start
- After the first 3 months, billing switches to monthly

### Growth System Subscription
- **First 3 months are also paid upfront** at engagement start
- After month 3, subscription fee continues monthly alongside ad management

### Summary of Upfront Amounts

| Option | Upfront at Start | Monthly After Month 3 |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Option 1 (Bulk Assets)** | 3 × ad mgmt + full asset bulk | Ad mgmt only |
| **Option 2 (Subscription)** | 3 × ad mgmt + 3 × subscription | Ad mgmt + subscription |

Example (Egyptian market at 12,500 EGP/mo ad mgmt, 5,500 EGP/mo subscription):
- **Option 1:** 37,500 + 45,000 = **82,500 EGP** upfront → 12,500 EGP/mo after
- **Option 2:** 37,500 + 16,500 = **54,000 EGP** upfront → 18,000 EGP/mo after

## Proposal Structure

Every proposal should include:
1. **What is included** — common scope across all options
2. **Two commercial options** — same scope, different payment models:
   - Option 1: Ad management + growth assets (bulk — client owns from day one)
   - Option 2: Ad management + Admireworks Growth System (subscription — assets transfer after 12 months)
3. **The approach** — specific strategy for this client
4. **Next steps** — decision + payment + kickoff
5. **Payment details** — Instapay link and account info

### Currency Display Rules
- Always show **both USD and local currency** for ad management fee
- Use `~$260 USD` with the EGP equivalent for Egyptian market clients
- Round all figures to clean numbers (no decimals, no odd amounts)
- Check current exchange rate at time of proposal creation
