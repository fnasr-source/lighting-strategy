# Admireworks Proposal Pricing Structure

> **Last Updated:** February 22, 2026
> **Source:** Fouad Nasseredin (verbal briefing)
> **Purpose:** Standard pricing reference for all future proposals

## Core Service: Ad Campaign Management

This is the main service — managing ad performance on **one ad platform** (typically Meta Ads).

### Egyptian Market Clients (campaigns targeting Egypt)
- **Price:** $260 USD/month equivalent in EGP
- **As of Feb 2026:** ~12,500 EGP/month (at ~47.5 EGP/USD)
- **Always round** to a clean, professional figure in the proposal

### International Market Clients
| Client Location | Monthly Price |
|---|---|
| **UAE** | 1,200 AED/month |
| **Saudi Arabia** | 1,200 SAR/month |
| **All other markets** | $330 USD/month equivalent |
| **Egyptian client targeting outside Egypt** | $330 USD/month equivalent |

> **Key rule:** If the client is Egyptian but their campaigns target a market outside Egypt, they pay the international rate ($330 USD equivalent), not the Egyptian rate.

## Asset Building (Add-On)

Asset building covers the creation of all marketing infrastructure: landing pages, lead funnels, campaign creative suites, follow-up flows, etc.

### Standard Rate
- **Full rate:** 12,500 EGP/month for 12 months (for some clients)
- **Reduced rate (50%):** 6,250 EGP/month (used for lighter scope or existing clients)

### Payment Options (present as two options in proposals)

**Option A — Bulk Payment:**
- 45,000 EGP one-time for asset building
- Assets are built over the first 3 months
- Lower monthly total (just ad management fee)

**Option B — Monthly Spread:**
- 6,250 EGP/month added to the monthly ad management fee
- Client pays **3 months upfront** for asset building at engagement start
- Total monthly = ad management + asset building (e.g., 12,500 + 6,250 = 18,750 EGP/month for Egyptian market)

### Asset Ownership
- Assets belong to Admireworks during the engagement
- **Assets are handed over to the client after 12 months of continuous service**
- If the client terminates before 12 months, assets are not handed over

---

## Upfront Payment Rules

### Ad Campaign Management
- **First 3 months are always paid upfront** at engagement start
- After the first 3 months, billing switches to monthly

### Asset Building (Monthly Spread option)
- **First 3 months are also paid upfront** at engagement start
- After month 3, asset building fee continues monthly alongside ad management

### Summary of Upfront Amounts

| Option | Upfront at Start | Monthly After Month 3 |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Option 1 (Bulk Assets)** | 3 × ad mgmt + full asset bulk | Ad mgmt only |
| **Option 2 (Monthly Assets)** | 3 × ad mgmt + 3 × asset monthly | Ad mgmt + asset monthly |

Example (Egyptian market at 12,500 EGP/mo ad mgmt, 6,250 EGP/mo assets):
- **Option 1:** 37,500 + 45,000 = **82,500 EGP** upfront → 12,500 EGP/mo after
- **Option 2:** 37,500 + 18,750 = **56,250 EGP** upfront → 18,750 EGP/mo after

## Proposal Structure

Every proposal should include:
1. **What is included** — common scope across all options
2. **Two commercial options** — same scope, different payment structures:
   - Option 1: Ad management + asset building (bulk)
   - Option 2: Ad management + asset building (monthly spread)
3. **The approach** — specific strategy for this client
4. **Next steps** — decision + payment + kickoff
5. **Payment details** — Instapay link and account info

### Currency Display Rules
- Always show **both USD and local currency** for ad management fee
- Use `~$260 USD` with the EGP equivalent for Egyptian market clients
- Round all figures to clean numbers (no decimals, no odd amounts)
- Check current exchange rate at time of proposal creation
