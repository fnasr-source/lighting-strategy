## Intended Use

1. Move `draft-peviews/` into the new previews repository.
2. In the other chat, ask it to:

- import the branding from `draft-peviews/_handoff/`
- map brand tokens/fonts/logos into that project's standard structure
- rebuild any shared presentation/theme files using these brand assets
3. After extraction into the target structure, delete `draft-peviews/` from that repository.
